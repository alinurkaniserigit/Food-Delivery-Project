that project has done.

Project Focus
In this project, I've meticulously crafted a technological marvel encompassing two distinct websites one of them admin panel and three specialized applications tailored for various user roles:

Customer Website and App: This user-centric interface offers customers the ability to explore local flavors, browse tantalizing menus, initiate orders with ease, and track deliveries in real time.

Seller Administrative Application: Focusing on the administrative aspect, this application equips restaurant owners with essential tools. Sellers can curate menus, adjust prices, manage incoming orders, and gain data-driven insights to enhance their offerings.

Delivery Personnel App: Ensuring timely and efficient deliveries, the delivery personnel application takes charge. Through intelligent task assignment, route optimization, and real-time communication, it forms the backbone of the platform's logistics.
